They were considered to be high value, due to them being the last of their race, which made them prime targets of robbers and traffickers.  Mikasa's mother, unfortunately, was killed, and Mikasa was going to be sold into trafficking, but Dr. Jaeger saved her from such a gruelingand horrific fate.</p>
