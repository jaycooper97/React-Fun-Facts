        experiences an extreme amount of pain.  This gives the Scouting Legion an advantage, once they realized Eren still
        had his consiousness.  Everyone was quite concerned at first; they didn't realize that Eren could still remain
        himself mentally when he transforms.  Once they saw "Titan Eren" in action against the other Titans, they saw the
        advantage they had with him.  He's about as tall as the other Titans, if not taller, and he has great mele√® combat skills!</p>
